## Prototypes
[Functional Prototype](https://unlocked.uqcloud.net/)  
[Figma Child v1 Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/MlzT7odzNrVjOlOuEDIo1BwQ/Child-DECO3500-v1.0-proto.io)  
[Figma Child v2 Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/cqpisfO3QWWrOmy0g2jqjy/NEW-Child-Prototype)  
[Figma Parent Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/nzJvonccucP9gDNFjf1rIL/NEW-Parents-app)  
  
The functional prototype can be set up by hosting the files in the prototype folder. A MySQL database is needed as the data is stored there. The database file (.sql) is included inside the prototype folder. Change the database connection details which is located in prototype/includes/connection.php to connect with your database. Once hosted, start navigation from the index.html file.
