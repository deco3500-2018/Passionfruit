## Project Aim
To create a high fidelity prototype that targets teenagers, and utilizes gamification methods to teach time management skills which will consequently combat mobile addiction.

## Concept Proposal
Our Proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Passionfruit/wiki/Concept-Proposal)

## Prototypes
[Functional Prototype](https://unlocked.uqcloud.net/)  
[Figma Child v1 Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/MlzT7odzNrVjOlOuEDIo1BwQ/Child-DECO3500-v1.0-proto.io)  
[Figma Child v2 Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/cqpisfO3QWWrOmy0g2jqjy/NEW-Child-Prototype)  
[Figma Parent Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/nzJvonccucP9gDNFjf1rIL/NEW-Parents-app)  

Setup:  
The functional prototype can be set up by hosting the files in the prototype folder. A MySQL database is needed as the data is stored there. The database file (.sql) is included inside the prototype folder.  

1. Download all the files from the prototype folder.  
2. Upload the files to a hosting service. A MySQL database is required. Create a database called 'unlocked' and import the .sql file. phpMyAdmin was used to manage our MySQL database.  
2. Change the database connection details which is located in prototype/includes/connection.php to connect with your database.  
3. Once hosted, start navigation from the index.html file.
