## Prototypes
Functional Prototype Zone: (https://unlocked.uqcloud.net/)

[Figma Child v2 Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/cqpisfO3QWWrOmy0g2jqjy/NEW-Child-Prototype)  
[Figma Parent Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/nzJvonccucP9gDNFjf1rIL/NEW-Parents-app)   
**Note:** The Figma prototypes do not have functional aspects, it is all simulated. All the functional aspects are in the [functional prototype](https://unlocked.uqcloud.net/).

## Project Aim
To create a high fidelity prototype that targets teenagers, and utilizes gamification methods to teach time management skills which will consequently combat mobile addiction.

## Concept Proposal
Our Proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Passionfruit/wiki/Concept-Proposal)

## Setup:  
The functional prototype can be set up by hosting the files in the prototype folder. A MySQL database is needed as the data is stored there. The database file (.sql) is included inside the prototype folder.  

1. Download all the files from the prototype folder.  
2. Upload the files to a hosting service. 
3. A MySQL database is required. Create a database called 'unlocked' and import the .sql file. phpMyAdmin was used to manage our MySQL database.  
4. Change the database connection details which is located in prototypedemo/includes/connection.php to connect with your database.  
5. Once hosted, start navigation from the index.html file.  

Instructions for use as a 'parent'  
1. Select parent option  
2. Fill in the details and sign up  
3. Login  
4. Generate code  
5. All linked accounts will display in the area under the generated code 
6. To clear all linked accounts / codes, clicked 'Reset All Codes'  
  
Instructions for use as a 'child'
1. Select child option
2. Enter code given from parent
3. If the linking is successful or fails, it will inform the user in the top right hand corner.
